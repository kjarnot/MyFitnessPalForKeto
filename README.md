# MyFitnessPal for Keto

A plugin that makes MyFitnessPal more keto friendly instead of calorie-centric.

* If you have “Carb” and “Fiber” columns on your food diary pages:
	* Adds “Net Carbs” column to your food diary pages
	* Adds “Net Carbs Remaining” table to “Your Daily Summary” widget on your dashboard
* If you have “Carb,” “Fiber,” “Protein,” and “Fat” columns on your food diary pages:
	* Adds percentages for “Net Carbs,” “Protein,” and “Fat” from a 4/4/9 ratio calculation of real calories for each meal and daily total on your food diary pages
	* Adds pie chart for your daily percentages of “Net Carbs,” “Protein,” and “Fat” from above to your food diary between your “Water Consumption” and “Today's Food Notes” sections
